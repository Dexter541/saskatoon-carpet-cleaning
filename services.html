							<br />
							<p>
								Saskatoon Carpet Cleaning specializes in upholstery cleaning that includes vehicles in Saskatoon and surrounding
								areas. We are the upholstery cleaning experts! The wear and tear of everyday life takes its toll on any type of
								furniture. Professional upholstery cleaning is essential for achieving the best results. Call Saskatoon Carpet
								Cleaning and you’ll see why we are rated higher than the competition. We offer the highest levels of professional

							</p>
							<p>
								Furniture upholstery can be very delicate, using the wrong detergent on the fabric can cause irreparable damage – it
								can cause the color of the fabric to fade, or spot of colors on the fabric. Therefore, before we start cleaning your
								upholstery, all the fabrics are pre-tested to avoid damage or color loss. Upholstery cleaning is a job for
								professionals. Let our staff renew the beauty and grandeur of your furnishings. Reliable and affordable upholstery
								cleaning service is our specialty. Generally speaking, people tend to overlook the benefits of using upholstery
								cleaning whenever they are enhancing the looks of their homes but as you can see below there are many benefits to
								getting your upholstery cleaned:
							</p>

							<h2 class="text-light">Benefit 1: Removes Allergens</h2>
							<p>
								It provides an opportunity to remove dust from your furniture, thus reducing the chances of the people living in the
								house developing allergies. In the end, this improves air quality and ensures that you have a healthy house.
							</p>
							<h2 class="text-light">Benefit 2: Longer Lasting Upholstery</h2>
							<p>
								Dust has jagged edges, which can scratch the fibres; the microscopic abrasions can cause your fabric to look thin and
								dull. Regular cleaning will often remove the dust at the same time, making it last for a longer time when compared to
								other solutions.
							</p>
							<h2 class="text-light">Benefit 3: Pleasing to the Eye</h2>
							<p>
								Steam cleaning or shampooing upholstery will always please your eyes since is among the best methods to make your
								furniture look amazing. Regular cleaning will often make your furniture remain looking like new.
							</p>
							<h2 class="text-light">Benefit 4: Fresh Smell</h2>
							<p>
								Furniture can often develop an unpleasant smell after time. A professional cleaning of the furniture will get rid of
								any foul odours, and make your house look and smell amazing.
							</p>
							<h2 class="text-light">Benefit 5: Durability of the Furniture</h2>
							<p>
								If the upholstery is left dusty and dirty, it will age faster and wear out. The easiest method to enhance its
								durability is to clean the upholstery! This will save you money on the cost of buying new furniture, and keep it
								looking great for a long period of time.

							<h3 class="services-page text-light">Professional Carpet Cleaning</h3>
							<br />
							<p>
								Carpets are a mainstay of flooring in homes and offices, and as such there is an entire industry dedicated to their
								care and maintenance. Regardless of how much time and effort you put into keeping your carpets in tip-top condition,
								there will likely come a time when you need to seek professional carpet cleaning services. Certainly, there are
								aspects of daily care that can extend the lifespan of your carpets and minimize the need for professional carpet
								cleaning. Scotch guarding protects against spills, regular vacuuming can prevent the buildup of dirt and debris, and
								immediate cleaning of spills can keep your carpets in excellent condition, but there are still many good reasons why
								you should hire a professional carpet cleaner.
							</p>
							<p>
								More thorough than even your regular carpet care, professional carpet cleaning utilizes steam and hot water extraction
								methods that penetrate deep into carpet fibres. While you may be tempted to take a do-it-yourself approach, there are
								a number of distinct advantages to professional cleaning. First of all, since steam cleaning your carpet is
								recommended once every two years, the costs associated with this duty are minimal. Though you may feel you save money
								by doing it on your own, you are probably only partially correct. Professional carpet cleaners have industrial
								equipment and extensive knowledge of carpet cleaning chemicals so they will choose the right products for your job.
							</p>
							<p>
								In fact, one of the biggest mistakes home or business owners make in cleaning their own carpets is choosing a cleaning
								chemical that ultimately ends up damaging the carpet. So potentially, you could be faced with the expensive
								replacement of your carpets whereas you were hoping to save a few bucks on your cleaning costs. Still, even if you
								choose an appropriate cleaner, you may not know the appropriate amount to use and your carpets may not be as
								thoroughly cleaned.
							</p>
							<p>
								Additionally, as part of a professional carpet cleaning service, your cleaner will effectively dry your carpets in
								order to prevent the formation of mold and mildew. While there will be some dampness after your professional cleaning,
								do-it-yourself cleaners often do not have the best equipment and the carpets are left far too wet.
							</p>
							<p>
								Finally, professional carpet cleaners not only consider the actual cleaning job, but also the impact on chemicals and
								cleaners on the environment. For example, a professional cleaner will use chemicals that are not harmful to pets or
								children when they are cleaning homes, but may choose stronger cleaners in office or business environments.
							</p>
							<p>
								While you may feel confident in your ability to clean your own carpets, hiring a professional should give you peace of
								mind that the job will be completed correctly so that your carpets last longer.

							<h3 class="services-page text-light">Carpet and Upholstery Care</h3>
							<br />
							<p>
								Carpets with their beautiful coloring bring a touch of art into every personal and work environment. Maintenance for
								any carpet is a delicate process and it requires professional attention on a regular basis to keep it looking fresh
								and healthy. Thus anyone in the carpet cleaning profession must have comprehensive knowledge about the different types
								of carpets and the different materials that are available to care for them.
							</p>
							<p>
								When it comes to getting your carpets cleaned, be aware. Why?! Because there are good chemicals and low quality
								chemicals.
							</p>
							<p>
								The professional needs to know what chemicals are appropriate for each specific carpet and which chemical will cause
								irreparable damage to that same carpet.
							</p>
							<p>
								We use the best products that are out there and we know what cleaning method will provide the best possible result. So
								when you do business with us, expect an exceptional experience and the best possible results. Contact us to learn more

							<p>
								Our carpet binding service turns leftover carpet remnants into beautiful area rugs. Carpet binding is the process of

								desired. Our surging service ensures that your carpet edges are neat, durable, and aesthetically pleasing. We offer a
